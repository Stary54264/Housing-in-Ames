# Housing in Ames

## Overview

This repo contains all the files needed for analysis of housing data in Ames, Iowa.


## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data` contains the raw data as obtained from `AmesHousing` package, and the cleaned data that can be used directly for linear regression.
-   `document` contains the requirement for this project and the group agreement.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `script` contains the R scripts used to download and clean data.


## Part 2

**Flowchart Appearance**
-   [X] Does not exceed two 8.5x11 inch pages in length.
-   [X] Legend is provided correctly distinguishing each module of course material required.
-   [X] Legible and easy to read without excessive magnification

**Use of Flowchart Elements**
-   [X] All decision steps are questions answerable by yes/no and denoted using correct shape.
-   [X] All arrows are unidirectional, point in the correct direction and are properly labelled when exiting decision step.
-   [X] All action steps are denoted using correct shape.
-   [X] Start/End points (and, where applicable, continuations) are denoted using correct shape with appropriate labels.

**Modules 1 & 2 Content**
-   [X] An initial/preliminary model is explicitly provided and is described in the context of the research question.
-   [X] Steps that involve changing the initial model explicitly indicate that a new model has been fit to reflect this change with the exact change noted.
-   [X] Categorical (not individual indicator) variables in each model should be treated appropriately throughout the steps of the flowchart (e.g., tests applied correctly, plots appropriate to variable type, etc.)

**Module 3 Content**
-   [X] All assumptions/conditions are assessed and explicitly mentioned.
-   [X] Tools used to assess each assumption/condition are appropriate and based on instructor-created materials and are explicitly described using appropriate course terminology.
-   [X] How violated assumptions/conditions are identified is explicitly described using appropriate course terminology and is correct.

**Module 4 Content**
-   [X] Each violated assumption is addressed.
-   [X] Choice of tool to address each violated assumption is appropriate.
-   [X] How tool will be used to address each violated assumption is described correctly using appropriate course terminology.

**Modules 5 & 6 Content**
-   [X] Inferential tool being used is explicitly described using correct terminology from the course and is identifiable by the reader.
-   [X] How conclusions are made using inferential tool are correct and explicitly stated.
-   [X] Conclusions from inferential tool are valid based on previous steps.

**Research Question**
-   [X] The research question being addressed (like you did in final project part 1) is explicitly stated with identifiable response and predictor variables at the beginning of the flowchart.
-   [X] For each endpoint listed in the flowchart, it is explicitly stated how the steps leading to the endpoint could yield an answer to your research question.
-   [X] The potential answers to the research question are appropriate based on previous steps.


## Part 1

**Proposed Research Question**
-   [X] The response variable of interest is clearly identifiable, and the predictors hypothesized to be related to the response are explicitly stated (or at minimum groups of common predictor characteristics are listed).
-   [X] It is phrased using clear language and familiar terminology and makes a clear hypothesis about the population relationship.
-   [X] It is directly connected to the stated importance/relevance of the project topic.

**Literature Summary**
-   [X] Three legitimate peer-reviewed articles are summarized.
-   [X] The main result of each article is summarized concisely and in the context of the original study population.
-   [X] A strong and explicit connection is made between each articleâ€™s results and the proposed research question.

**Suitability of Linear Regression**
-   [X] Uses appropriate terminology from the course materials.
-   [X] Provides a reasonable justification for why and how estimating a linear trend will answer the research question proposed.
-   [X] Provides a reasonable justification for whether the focus of the model will be on interpretability (description) or precision/accuracy (prediction).

**Description of Data Source**
-   [X] Where the data was sourced/downloaded from is explicitly mentioned with a corresponding citation in the bibliography.
-   [X] The original usage or purpose of the dataset is described, and it is explicit how that usage differs from the current research proposal.
-   [X] How the data were originally collected by the curator of the dataset is described and a corresponding reference is cited from the bibliography.

**Predictor Variable Summaries**
-   [X] An appropriate and suitably presentable numerical or graphical summary is used to statistically describe the chosen predictor variables.
-   [X] Important/interesting variable characteristics (e.g. skews, abnormal values) or lack thereof are, in the context of what is being measured/the research question.
-   [X] A justification for why the chosen predictor variables are relevant to answering the research question, making explicit reference to the summarized literature and to any modifications to variables that have been made.

**Residual Analysis of Preliminary Model**
-   [X] All plots needed for a complete residual analysis have been presented, are correct, and are easily readable with appropriate axes and labels.
-   [X] Each assumption and condition are assessed and a conclusion for each is provided.
-   [X] Correct details are provided, with reference to the appropriate plot, to describe how such a conclusion was made for each assumption and condition.

**Preliminary Model Discussion**
-   [X] Model estimates from preliminary model are presented in an easily readable, understandable, and professional way.
-   [X] A discussion on what these estimates tell the reader about a possible answer to the research question is provided in context, highlighting the effect of at least one numerical and one categorical predictor explicitly.
-   [X] A comparison is made between the preliminary model results and those summarised from the literature, and it is discussed why these may be similar or different.

**Overall Proposal Formatting**
-   [X] The bibliography and in-text citations are formatted correctly using a consistent style.
-   [X] Word counts for each section are met or are no more than 15 words in excess.
-   [X] Headers and paragraphs are used effectively to increase readability and separate ideas for increased comprehension.
-   [X] No R code or R output (other than plots) are displayed in the written proposal.

**Ethics Discussion**
-   [X] Answer correctly references some of the criteria discussed in the first ethics module.
-   [X] Response makes a reasonable and clear attempt to argue for its conclusion.
-   [X] Meets minimum and maximum word count.
