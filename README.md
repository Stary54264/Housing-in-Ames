# Analyzing Influencing Factors of House Prices in Ames by Linear Regression

## Overview

This repo contains all the files needed for analysis of housing data in Ames, Iowa.


## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data` contains the raw data as obtained from `AmesHousing` package, and the cleaned data that can be used directly for linear regression.
-   `document` contains the requirement for this project and the group agreement.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `script` contains the R scripts used to download and clean data.


## Part 3

**Report - Introduction**
-   [X] The research question is stated with explicit mention of the response and predictors (or common predictor groups) in general (non-technical) terms, and it is explicitly mentioned why this question/topic is important/relevant.
-   [X] The results of at least three peer-reviewed academic journal articles are used to describe what is already known about the topic and how this knowledge will be integrated into the study.
-   [X] An appropriate justification is given on how a linear model can be used to answer this research question and whether the focus will be on interpretability/description or prediction.

**Report - Methods**
-   [X] How a final model for answering the research question is developed using the course material is explicitly and logically outlined.
-   [X] All assumptions are explicitly assessed and options for mitigating the potential violations are explicitly mentioned.
-   [X] All model diagnostics are explicitly stated and options for mitigating any issues are explicitly mentioned.
-   [X] The order in which the model building, assessment of assumptions and model diagnostic steps would proceed is explicit.
-   [X] Details are provided to describe what tools are used and how conclusions are drawn in each case above and are appropriate/correct.

**Report - Results**
-   [X] Process of determining a final model is organized logically, is easy to follow, is consistent with the methods section, and highlights important decisions made to arrive at final model rather than documenting every small step in the analysis.
-   [X] Appropriate evidence is provided to support conclusions and decisions to arrive at the final model, and this evidence is referenced explicitly.
-   [X] Conclusions of model selection method(s)/tool(s) are correct and appropriate based on previous analysis results/steps.
-   [X] Information is provided to confirm that model assumptions have been assessed and model diagnostics have been performed correctly and in appropriate places.
-   [X] The final model that is used to answer the research question is presented in a professional and easily understandable way.

**Report - Conclusion and Limitations**
-   [X] An explicit answer to the research question is provided and is consistent with how a linear model was proposed to answer the question in the introduction.
-   [X] One estimated coefficient is correctly interpreted formally using course terminology in the context of the research question.
-   [X] A brief discussion is provided on whether the answer to the research question is surprising or consistent with the literature from the introduction.
-   [X] Limitations of the analysis (or lack of) are identified (e.g. extreme observations, violated assumptions, limited data, etc.) and the impact of these are correctly identified.

**Report - Figures and Tables**
-   [X] All figures/tables are correctly labelled (e.g., Figure 1) and have informative captions describing the main message of the figure/table.
-   [X] All figures/tables have meaningful titles, axis labels (if applicable) and variable names.
-   [X] All figures/tables presented in the report and the appendix are referred to in the text.
-   [X] Individual plots that are combined into a single figure are appropriately sized and easy to read.

**Report - Structure and Readability**
-   [X] Each section of the report meets the maximum word count or exceeds it by only 15 words.
-   [X] The report is well structured, with appropriate sections and appropriate usage of paragraphs for increased readability.
-   [X] The report does not contain R code or output copied directly from R.
-   [X] References are written in an appropriate and consistent citation format.

**Poster - Research Question and Data**
-   [X] The research question is explicitly stated and a clear motivation for this topic is provided.
-   [X] The source of the data is explicitly stated/provided and why it is appropriate to use to answer the question is correctly stated.
-   [X] A discussion on how the data were originally collected and why it may be trustworthy or reliable is provided.

**Poster - Analysis and Conclusions**
-   [X] The methods/techniques employed to answer the research question are outlined.
-   [ ] An answer to the research question is provided which is consistent with the analysis and evidence presented.
-   [X] Sufficient evidence is presented that allows the reader to understand how the research question was answered and to evaluate whether the process was correct.
-   [ ] Limitations of the analysis are correctly noted with a suggestion for improvement for future studies.

**Poster - Appearance**
-   [X] The poster does not contain a burdensome amount of text that could have been replaced with the use of figures or tables.
-   [X] Figures and tables chosen are clear and convey an intentional message with appropriate labels and captions.
-   [X] The poster is logical and understandable without the need for additional or supplemental materials (i.e. can be understood without reading the full report).

**Ethics Discussion**
-   [X] Answer meets the minimum and maximum word count.
-   [X] Response makes a reasonably clear attempt to argue for its conclusion.
-   [X] Answer refers to some concepts and ideas found in the second ethics module.

**Editing Demonstration**
-   [X] The editing technique employed was stated and a reason for this choice was provided.
-   [X] Both an original and an edited writing sample are provided, and notable improvements were made reflecting the editing focus stated.
-   [X] A short reflection is provided discussing what went well and what was challenging in editing the writing sample.
