# Housing in Ames

## Overview

This repo contains all the files needed for analysis of housing data in Ames, Iowa.


## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data` contains the raw data as obtained from `AmesHousing` package, and the cleaned data that can be used directly for linear regression.
-   `document` contains the requirement for this project and the group agreement.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `script` contains the R scripts used to download and clean data.


## Criteria

Proposed research question
-   [ ] The response variable of interest is clearly identifiable, and the predictors hypothesized to be related to the response are explicitly stated (or at minimum groups of common predictor characteristics are listed).
-   [ ] It is phrased using clear language and familiar terminology and makes a clear hypothesis about the population relationship.
-   [ ] It is directly connected to the stated importance/relevance of the project topic.

Literature summary
-   [ ] Three legitimate peer-reviewed articles are summarized.
-   [ ] The main result of each article is summarized concisely and in the context of the original study population.
-   [ ] A strong and explicit connection is made between each articleâ€™s results and the proposed research question.

Suitability of linear regression
-   [ ] Uses appropriate terminology from the course materials.
-   [ ] Provides a reasonable justification for why and how estimating a linear trend will answer the research question proposed.
-   [ ] Provides a reasonable justification for whether the focus of the model will be on interpretability (description) or precision/accuracy (prediction).

Description of data source
-   [ ] Where the data was sourced/downloaded from is explicitly mentioned with a corresponding citation in the bibliography.
-   [ ] The original usage or purpose of the dataset is described, and it is explicit how that usage differs from the current research proposal.
-   [ ] How the data were originally collected by the curator of the dataset is described and a corresponding reference is cited from the bibliography.

Predictor variable summaries
-   [ ] An appropriate and suitably presentable numerical or graphical summary is used to statistically describe the chosen predictor variables.
-   [ ] Important/interesting variable characteristics (e.g. skews, abnormal values) or lack thereof are, in the context of what is being measured/the research question.
-   [ ] A justification for why the chosen predictor variables are relevant to answering the research question, making explicit reference to the summarized literature and to any modifications to variables that have been made.

Residual analysis of preliminary model
-   [ ] All plots needed for a complete residual analysis have been presented, are correct, and are easily readable with appropriate axes and labels.
-   [ ] Each assumption and condition are assessed and a conclusion for each is provided.
-   [ ] Correct details are provided, with reference to the appropriate plot, to describe how such a conclusion was made for each assumption and condition.

Preliminary model discussion
-   [ ] Model estimates from preliminary model are presented in an easily readable, understandable, and professional way.
-   [ ] A discussion on what these estimates tell the reader about a possible answer to the research question is provided in context, highlighting the effect of at least one numerical and one categorical predictor explicitly.
-   [ ] A comparison is made between the preliminary model results and those summarised from the literature, and it is discussed why these may be similar or different.

Overall Proposal Formatting
-   [ ] The bibliography and in-text citations are formatted correctly using a consistent style.
-   [ ] Word counts for each section are met or are no more than 15 words in excess.
-   [ ] Headers and paragraphs are used effectively to increase readability and separate ideas for increased comprehension.
-   [ ] No R code or R output (other than plots) are displayed in the written proposal.

Ethics Discussion
-   [ ] Answer correctly references some of the criteria discussed in the first ethics module.
-   [ ] Response makes a reasonable and clear attempt to argue for its conclusion.
-   [ ] Meets minimum and maximum word count.
